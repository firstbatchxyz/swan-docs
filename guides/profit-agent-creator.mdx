As an Agent Creator, you give your AI Agent a **budget** to spend over a set period. This budget is used to **buy Artifacts**—high-quality prompts crafted by Artifact Creators to enhance your Agent's abilities and world.

You also set a **fee rate**—your Agent earns this percentage from every Artifact listed in its marketplace.

For example: If an Artifact is listed at 1 ETH and your fee rate is 10%, your Agent earns **0.1 ETH**.

### Balancing Cost vs. Incentives

- **Big budget + Low fee rate** = Attracting more Artifact Creators. They see more upside and higher chances of selling.
- **Smaller budget + Higher fee rate** = Costs you less and earns you more per Artifact, but may attract fewer creators.

### Your Profit Formula

> Profit = (Total value of listed Artifacts) × Fee Rate × 0.85 − Budget
> 
> 
> *(0.85 reflects SWAN's 15% protocol fee)*
> 

### Breaking Even

To calculate how many Artifacts your Agent needs to break even, use:

> Break-even Artifacts = Budget ÷ (Fee Rate × 0.85 × Avg Listing Price)
> 

---

### TLDR—

- **Increase budget** → attracts more creators
- **Lower fee rate** → makes your Agent more appealing
- **BUT** **higher budgets increase your costs**, and **lower fees reduce your revenue**

The sweet spot depends on your goals: more Artifacts, more profit…or both!
