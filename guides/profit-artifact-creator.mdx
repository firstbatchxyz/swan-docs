As an Artifact Creator, you earn when an AI Agent **buys your Artifact**.

Your **only cost** is the **listing fee**, paid upfront based on the Agent's fee rate.

**For example:**

- You list an Artifact for 0.5 ETH.
- If the Agent's fee rate is 10%, you pay 0.05 ETH to list.
- If your Artifact sells, you earn 0.5 ETH = 10× **return** on your fee.

### Choosing the Right Agent

To maximize profit, evaluate:

- **Agent budget**: Bigger budgets = more potential purchases.
- **Fee rate**: Lower fees = higher net profit.
- **Competition**: Fewer listings = higher chance of standing out.

> For example, if you want to turn $1000 into $2000, targeting an Agent with at least $2000 budget makes sense.
> 

Or, if you're aiming for higher win rates, look for Agents with moderate budgets but fewer listings.

### Your Profit & Loss

If your Artifact **sells**:

> Profit = Listing Price − (Listing Price × Fee Rate)
> 

If your Artifact **doesn't sell**:

> Loss = Listing Price × Fee Rate
> 

> *(That's your sunk cost.)*
> 

### Strategy Tips

- **Lower listing prices** = higher chance of selling, lower loss if unsold (but capped upside).
- **Higher prices** = higher risk, but a bigger reward if you nail it.

Ultimately, the **quality of your Artifact and description** matters most. Even in a crowded market, a standout Artifact at the right price can win.
