## Understanding the Network

Dria operates on a distributed network of compute nodes that execute your workflows. Before running intensive tasks, you can check the availability of models across the network to ensure optimal performance.

### Checking Model Availability

You can query the current state of the network using the `check_model_availability()` function:

```python
# Check which models are available on the network
await dria.check_model_availability()
```

This function returns a table showing which models are available and how many nodes can execute each model:

```
Model Availability 
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Model                  ┃ Available Nodes ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ GEMINI_20_FLASH       │ 10             │
│ GEMINI                │ 10             │
│ OLLAMA                │ 23             │
│ TINY_AGENT_3B         │ 13             │
│ QWEN2_5_7B_FP16       │ 10             │
│ GEMINI                │ 10             │
│ ANTHROPIC_HAIKU_3_5_OR│ 5              │
│ GPT4O_MINI            │ 5              │
│ OPENAI                │ 5              │
│ OPENROUTER            │ 5              │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

This information helps you select appropriate models based on current network capacity and ensures your workflows can be executed efficiently across the distributed infrastructure.


## Advanced Workflows

Dria allows you to create complex workflows for generating synthetic data. This section covers advanced techniques for building sophisticated data generation pipelines.


### Sequential Workflows
Sequential workflows execute steps one after another, with each step using the output of the previous step.

<CodeGroup>
```python Sequential Example
from dria import WorkflowTemplate, Dria, Model


class SequentialWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    """
    A sequential workflow that processes steps one after another.
    """
    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        # First step generates topics
        step1 = self.add_step(
            "Generate topic about {{domain}}",
            output="topic" # Output key for first step. Will be used as input for second step.
        )
        # Second step generates article about topic
        step2 = self.add_step(
            "Write an article about {{topic}}",
        )
        self.connect(step1, step2) # Connect the two steps each other.


async def main():
    dria = Dria()
    return await dria.generate(
        inputs={
            "domain": "AI",
        },
        workflow=SequentialWorkflow,
        models=Model.GEMINI_20_FLASH
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    print(asyncio.run(main()))

```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Sequential workflows are ideal for tasks that require a strict order of operations, where each step depends on the output of the previous step.
</Note>

## Multi-Step Pipelines
Pipelines enables complex data processing with parallel execution of tasks.

<CodeGroup>
```python Multi-Step Pipeline Example
from typing import List, Any

from dria import WorkflowTemplate, Dria, Model, TaskResult


class MainTopicWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        # Generate main topic
        self.add_step("Generate a main topic about {{domain}}")

    def callback(self, result: List[TaskResult]) -> Any:
        return [{"main_topic": r.result} for r in result]

class SubtopicsWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        # Generate subtopics based on the main topic
        self.add_step("List smaller subtopics related to {{main_topic}}")

    def callback(self, result: List[TaskResult]) -> Any:
        return [{"subtopics": r.result} for r in result]

class ContentWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        # Generate content for each subtopic
        self.add_step("Write a short paragraph about {{subtopics}}")

async def main():
    dria = Dria()
    return await dria.generate(
        inputs={
            "domain": "AI",
        },
        workflow=[MainTopicWorkflow, SubtopicsWorkflow, ContentWorkflow],
        # Each model is matched with same index on workflow list.
        # MainTopicWorkflow -> Model.GPT4O
        # SubtopicsWorkflow -> Model.GEMINI_20_FLASH
        # ContentWorkflow -> Model.ANTHROPIC_SONNET_3_5_OR
        models=[Model.GPT4O, Model.GEMINI_20_FLASH, Model.ANTHROPIC_SONNET_3_5_OR]
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    print(asyncio.run(main()))

```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Parallel processing is particularly effective for handling multiple independent subtasks simultaneously, significantly improving execution time for complex workflows.
You can decide each workflow's configuration separately.
</Tip>

## Web Search Grounded Workflows
Web search grounded workflows integrate real-world information into your synthetic data generation, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

<CodeGroup>
```python Web Search Example
from dria_workflows import Operator

from dria import WorkflowTemplate, Dria, Model

class WebGroundedWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        # Search step to gather real-world information
        search_step = self.add_step(
            prompt="{{topic}}",
            operation=Operator.SEARCH,
            search_type="search", # search is default option. You can change to "news" or "scholar" for be more specific.
            search_lang="en",
            search_n_results=5, # Use top 5 search results
            output="search_results"
        )

        # Analysis step to process search results
        analysis_step = self.add_step(
            prompt="Analyze these search results and identify key trends: {{search_results}}",
            output="analysis"
        )

        # Content generation step
        content_step = self.add_step(
            prompt="Using this analysis {{analysis}}, generate detailed content about {{topic}}",
            output="final_content"
        )

        # Connect all steps
        self.connect(search_step, analysis_step)
        self.connect(analysis_step, content_step)

async def main():
    dria = Dria()
    return await dria.generate(
        inputs={
            "topic": "AI",
        },
        workflow=WebGroundedWorkflow,
        models=Model.GEMINI
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    print(asyncio.run(main()))

```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
When using web search grounded workflows, ensure your search queries are specific enough to return relevant results.
</Warning>

<Info>
These workflow patterns can be combined and nested to create sophisticated data generation pipelines tailored to your specific needs.
</Info>

### Structured Outputs

For generating data in specific formats:

```python
from typing import List, Any

from pydantic import Field
from pydantic import BaseModel

from dria import Dria, WorkflowTemplate, Model, TaskResult


class StoryOutput(BaseModel):
    """Output schema for story generation."""
    title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the story")
    characters: List[str] = Field(..., description="Main characters in the story")
    story_text: str = Field(..., description="The full text of the generated story")


class SimpleStoryWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    max_tokens = 5000
    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        self.add_step(
            """Write a short story about {{topic}} that involves {{setting}}.
            Include at least {{num_characters}} character(s).""",
            schema=StoryOutput
        )


async def main():
    """
    Main function to demonstrate the execution of a custom workflow.

    Initializes the Dria client, configures a workflow with inputs,
    and executes it with the specified model.
    """
    dria = Dria()
    return await dria.generate(
        inputs={
            "topic": "robot learning to paint",
            "setting": "space",
            "num_characters": "2"
        },
        workflow=SimpleStoryWorkflow,
        models=Model.GEMINI_20_FLASH
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```
